# Github Webhook Remotion video

Create super "beautiful" (not yet, but is coming in some later version 😄)

### Setup:

```bash
yarn install
yarn start

Then create a Github Webhook.
Point the webhook to a http tunnel (you can use [ngrok](https://ngrok.com)), or if you're in production simply point it to your domain.

### Contribution:

I appriciate all contribution! Just leave a pull request and i will hopefully approve it as soon as possible! 😄
